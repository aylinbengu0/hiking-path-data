## A Multi-Modal Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Hiking Route Difficulty Using Geographic and User Generated Data

The study aims to classify hiking paths using an objective approach to handle identified problems. Combining user-generated data from the Wikiloc platform with quantified geographical data obtained from the GPX file sought to create a more consistent approach.




Our methodology consists of three primary components:
1) Data collection and processing consist of GPX files, user-generated interpretation, and image extraction.
2) Data analysis approaches include the Haversine formula, which determines the distance between two points, as well as the computation of elevation change.
3) Development and evaluation of machine learning models to detect trail complexity based on the data obtained. (On going)

This study seeks to improve route selection for hikers of all experience levels using a more consistent framework for assessing hiking trails, therefore strengthening the accuracy of difficulty ratings. This work offers the possibility to enhance usability, safety, and accessibility in hiking apps using a data-driven categorization system. Future uses might be real-time difficulty modifications depending on terrain changes, weather, and even user fitness levels, therefore changing the way hikers engage with digital trail maps.
